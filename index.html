        <h3 class="title underline tomato">A system with two programmers possesses greater potential for the generation
            of more
            diverse
            solutions to
            problems for three reasons:</h3>

        <ul class="my-list">
            <li>
                the programmers bring different prior experiences to the task;
            </li>
            <li>
                they may assess information relevant to the task in different ways;
            </li>
            <li>
                they stand in different relationships to the problem by virtue of their functional roles.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="description">
            In an attempt to share goals and plans, the programmers must overtly negotiate a shared course of action
            when a
            conflict arises between them. In doing so, they consider a larger number of ways of solving the problem than
            a
            single programmer alone might do. This significantly improves the design quality of the program as it
            reduces
            the chances of selecting a poor method.

        <h3 class="title underline gold">online survey of pair programmers from 2000</h3>
        <p> 96% of programmers stated that they enjoyed work more while pair programming than programming alone.
            Furthermore, 95% said that they were more confident in their work when they pair programmed.</p>
